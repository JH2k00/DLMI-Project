# DLMI-Project
This repository contains our project for the Deep Learning for Medical Imaging WS2023/24 lecture at the Technical University of Darmstadt
# Progress
The Project is done. The models can still be improved (See TODOs), however the GUI and models are already fully functional.
# TODOs
- Allow users to open and close tabs as they please
- See [Simplifying Neural Network Training Under Class Imbalance](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.02517.pdf) for new tips and tricks for imbalanced data (Implement SAM)
