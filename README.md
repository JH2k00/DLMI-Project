# DLMI-Project
This repository contains our project for the Deep Learning for Medical Imaging WS2023/24 lecture at the Technical University of Darmstadt
# TODOs
- Add QThreads support to deal with algorithms in parallel
- Allow users to open and close tabs as they please
- Tackle training under severe class imbalance. Possibly by using the unlabeled data for self-supervised Learning.
- See [Simplifying Neural Network Training Under Class Imbalance](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.02517.pdf) for new tips and tricks for imbalanced data
